# KPop Triva Web Game

A KPop Trivia web game that selects questions one-at-a-time from a question bank and displays the question and possible answers on screen. After an answer is selected, it can be submitted to see if it is true or false.

A correctly answered question awards 100 points. Questions do not repeat. 

After all the questions are answered, the game ends and can be re-started, or the game can be restarted at any time by refreshing the page.
